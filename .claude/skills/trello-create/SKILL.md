description: Create a Trello card on a board and list with the trello-cli (mheap) command line tool
argument-hint: "<title> [--board <name>] [--list <name>] [--from <markdown file>]"
---
Create one Trello card with the `trello` CLI (`npm install -g trello-cli`, mheap/trello-cli 1.8+).

The arguments are: $ARGUMENTS

## Defaults and conventions

- Board defaults to `AppShapes` (id `65be2d49d367b88f7e35ab55`, in the AppShapes workspace) and list
  defaults to `Wanting` (the intake list). Other lists on that board: Doing, Deploying, Releasing, Supporting.
- Titles are plain, without a ticket number. Trello assigns the card number (`idShort`), which
  is what commits reference (`20: ...`) and what appears in the card URL (`/20-slug`). A piece of
  work with a card of its own uses that card's number.
- If a markdown file is given (`--from`), its first `# Heading` is the title and the rest is the
  description. Trello descriptions render markdown.
- Never put an API key, a personal access token or any other credential on a card: a card is as
  public as the board.

## Steps

1. Auth lives in `~/.trello-cli/default/config.json` (`apiKey`, `token`). If a command reports a
   missing key or token, the values are under `## Trello CLI` in `~/.secrets/thinktech/secrets.md`
   (one Trello account serves every board); set them with `trello auth:api-key <key>` and
   `trello auth:token <token>`, never echo them.
2. If any command says `no such table: boards`, run `trello sync` once (it caches boards and
   lists locally) and retry.
3. Create the card. Pass the description through a file to avoid shell quoting problems:
   ```
   trello card:create --board "AppShapes" --list "Wanting" --name "<title>" \
       --description "$(sed '1{/^# /d;}' card.md)" --format json
   ```
   Optional flags: `--label <name>` (repeatable), `--due "<date or natural language>"`,
   `--position top|bottom`.
4. Read the returned JSON and report the card number and URL: the number is the path segment
   before the slug in `url` (`/c/<short>/<number>-<slug>`); `id` is the long id.
5. To attach a link afterwards: `trello card:attach --board ... --list ... --card "<title>" --url <url>`.
   To add a checklist: `trello card:checklist ... --name "<name>"`.

## Report

One line per card: number, title, list, URL. Do not paste the description back.
