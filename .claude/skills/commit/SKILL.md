description: Commit, pull, and push changes using make push with a card-prefixed message
argument-hint: "[card]"
---

Commit the current working tree changes using this project's `make push` target.

`make push` = `make commit` + `git push`. `make commit` alone pulls, tests, checks the plugin tree, stages and
commits, but does NOT push — so this skill uses `make push`.

The card number is: $ARGUMENTS

## 1. Validate the card number

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or non-numeric, stop and ask the user to provide a numeric Trello card number (e.g.,
`/commit 45`). Do not proceed.

## 2. Analyze changes

Run these commands in parallel to understand what will be committed:

- `git status` (never use `-uall`)
- `git diff`
- `git diff --cached`
- `git log --oneline -5`

If the working tree is clean (no staged, unstaged, or untracked changes), inform the user there is nothing to
commit and stop.

Remember: `make push` runs `git add --verbose :/ .` before committing, so ALL working tree changes will be
included, not just staged files. It also runs `git pull` BEFORE the test gates, so the gates run against the
MERGED tree rather than a stale one.

## 3. Check for secrets

Scan every added line (`+` prefix) in the diff output — in ALL files, not just code files — for anything that
looks like a secret: API keys, passwords, tokens, connection strings, private keys, or credentials. Non-code files
(markdown, prompts, config notes) are just as likely to contain secrets. If found, warn the user and do not
proceed until they confirm the files are safe.

## 4. Generate the commit message

Based on the changes, write a commit message:

- Format: `<card>: <Message>` (e.g., `45: Append the TL;DR on the final chunk`)
- One line, under 72 characters when possible
- Imperative mood, capitalized first word after the card prefix
- Summarize the intent (why), not a list of files changed
- Avoid shell-special characters (quotes, backticks, dollar signs) in the message

## 5. Confirm with the user

Present the full make command that will be executed:

```
make push "message=<card>: <generated message>"
```

Ask the user to confirm or provide an edited message. This operation pulls, tests, checks the plugin tree,
commits and pushes -- never auto-execute.

## 6. Execute

Once confirmed, run exactly:

```
make push "message=<confirmed message>"
```

## 7. Report the result

- On success, confirm the commit was pushed.
- On failure (test failure, plugin-check failure, merge conflict), report the error clearly. Do not retry
  automatically.
